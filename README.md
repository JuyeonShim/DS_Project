### DS_Project
# This page is for Uploading Pitchability Test Game Using FPGA(2023)

## Programming Language
Verilog_VIVADO
using FPGA Board

## Discription
This project use piezoelectric buzzer, button switch, sevensensegment.

When an FPGA board makes a certain pitch with a piezoelectric buzzer,
the game player hits that pitch. 

In this project, we use the player's execution time so that the random seed could be used depending on the moment the game player first presses the button.
